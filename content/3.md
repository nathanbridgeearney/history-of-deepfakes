    ## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [left-center][1]

    {In 2014 one the most important papers for deepfake realism is released, titled “Generative Adversarial Networks”, this paper has been cited over 70,000 times according to google scholar. GANs are also used in the detection process, as they can leave behind identifiable "fingerprints"}[left-center][1]

    ## Generative Adversarial Networks [left-center][1]

    {A GAN is a neural network is comprised of a Generator and a Discriminator, the Generator model creates the synthetic media, and the Discriminator model tries to differentiate between the generated and real media. GANs are also used in the detection process, as they can leave behind identifiable "fingerprints".}[left-center][1]

    ## Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes [left-center][1]

    {Released in 2020, this paper A VAE also uses two networks, in this case an Encoder and a Decoder. The first compresses input data into a efficient but human unreadable format. The second tries to recreate the original data from the compressed data. To apply this to deepfakes, the encoder is trained on the first subject and the decoder on the second. This will then try recreate the second subject onto image of the first subject. }[left-center][1]

    ## Transformers [left-center][1]

    {The 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" was the first to introduce what we know as modern transformers. The authors tested their models by using it to translate from English to French and German [15]. Transformers are now the most common model used in the creation of synthetic media, used by both Chat-GPT and DALL-E. The technology has improved considerably, able to create synthetic text, audio, images and video. Transformers also facilitated the creation of convolutional neural networks. }[left-center][1]

    ## The term Deepfake [left-center][1]

    {In 2017 Reddit user "u/deepfakes" releases output examples of their face-swapping software, sadly in the form of celebrities faces in pornagraphic videos. This began the popularisation of the term Deepfake, which has since been added to the Oxford Dictionary. The impressive part of this achievement was that this was the first time this was done using open source resources and on a home desktop. Less than a year after "u/deepfakes" started posting to reddit, a sepearte account "u/deepfakeapp" created and released an application that would allow anyone to create deepfakes. This program was called FakeApp and although based on the "u/deepfakes" model, FakeApp was created seperately. [12] }[left-center][1]
