    ## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [left-center][1]

    {In 2014 the most important paper for deepfake realism is released, bringing GANs with it. A GAN is a neural network is comprised of a Generator and a Discriminator, the Generator model creates the synthetic media, and the Discriminator model tries to differentiate between the generated and real media. GANs are also used in the detection process, as they can leave behind identifiable "fingerprints".  }[left-center][1]
