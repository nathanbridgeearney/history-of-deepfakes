applicationTitle: "Automated Lipsyncing Video Rewriting"
applicationDescription: |
    In the article "Video Rewrite: driving visual speech with audio" the authors are able to create a new video of a person with their mouth saying something that wasn't in the original footage via audio input. It uses computer-vision to track specific points of the mouth of the original video and morphs these points to match the target. This was the first facial-animation system that was automated, and was able to generate a video of John F. Kennedy saying, “Read my lips” using two minutes of footage. For each person it rewrites it needs 26 labeled images, the only human input in the process.

    The paper proposed that this technology would be useful for dubbing, teleconferencing and special effects. It's compared to the special effects within the film "Forest Gump", which was a labour intensive redubbing at the time.

    In the article one of their examples uses John F. Kennedy, although deceased the choice to use a politician foreshadows the some of the more sinister applications. Generating of videos of politicians is a severe ethical concern, and with the rise of the internet at the time, could have been used to stir discontent and spread misinformation. The technology is not as good as modern techniques but this could still have been used to instigate violence towards groups or ruin peoples lives. Politicians are often chosen targets of these attacks as they are often polarising and appear on public media channels, providing training data.
    
    This was a huge leap in dubbing technology, able to do the work faster than the manual process. This could be used to save costs on reshoots of films, adapt films to other languages and other ethical uses. Due to the time period that this was released, it is unlikely that a home computer would be able to achieve this. However goverments, corperations and research labs likely had the computational power to abuse this technology.
