implicationDescription: |
    Face-swap is a concept that almost everyone has heard about before, it allows us to place a human or animals face onto another’s. Starting as a manual process, people would use programs like Photoshop to graft and then smooth out the swaps. Sometimes this was done as harmless joke between friends or to create other innocent swaps. In other cases, this was done to profit off public figure’s likeness, often advertising and pornography as in the early stage of the internet there was little to no legislation to  protect these people [3]. 
    
    Once again, the problem is consent, this only got worse as face-swapping became an automated process and was able to handle different viewpoints/lighting between the two images [4]. This was a major step forward towards live face-swapping which was achieved in Face2Face 2016 [5]. Face2Face is an important paper for the technology, however it like most of the others, uses public figures without permission, in this case the controversial Donald Trump was among them. Donald Trump remains a popular target of face-swaps and deepfakes. 
    
    Face-swapping improved consistently throughout the 2000’s but reached a much younger audience in 2016 when Snapchat released a Face-Swap “Lens”. Websites that were face-swapping celebrities onto nude images became popular online with little to no legal recourse for most victims.

    [3] - In 1998 figure Skater Nancy Kerrigan was one of the first high-profile victims of doctored pornography, however, was able to have the content removed through a restraining order.

    [4] - A system for exchanging faces with differences in viewpoint and illumination was created. The system is based on an algorithm that estimates 3D shape and texture, along with scene parameters such as pose and lighting, from images. Users are still required to click roughly 7 feature points and mark the hairline of the subject. Authors suggest that their work can be used in image processing, virtual try-on of hairstyles, and facial recognition.

    [5] - Allows for real-time face-swaps onto a video source, allowing for manipulation without a target knowing the video is changed. Would be helpful for dubbing to foreign languages when on conference calls.
