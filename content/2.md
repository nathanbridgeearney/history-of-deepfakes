    ## Overview [left-center][1]

    {Face-swap is a concept that almost everyone has heard about before, it allows us to place a human or animals face onto another’s. Starting as a manual process, people would use programs like Photoshop to graft and then smooth out the swaps. Sometimes this was done as harmless joke between friends or to create other innocent swaps. In other cases, this was done to profit off public figure’s likeness, often for advertising [3].}[left-center][1]

    ## Facial Reenactment [left-center][1]

    {Facial Reenactment is the practise of replacing subjects’ facial expressions with another subject. Often used in media to replace stunt doubles, "The Jurassic Park (1993)" is regarded as the first commercial use of this technology. This was done by filming scenes of the actress’s facial movement then rotoscoping and overlaying these onto the stunt women [8]. Initially a manual process like static face swaps, automated systems were eventually created.}[left-center][1]

    ## Consent & Public Figures [left-center][1]
    
    {Once again, the problem is consent, this only got worse as face-swapping became an automated process and was able to handle different viewpoints/lighting between the two images [4]. This was a major step forward towards live face-swapping which was achieved in Face2Face 2016 [5]. Face2Face is an important paper for the technology, however it like most of the others, uses public figures without permission, in this case the controversial Donald Trump was among them. United States presidents and presidential candiates remain a popular target of face-swaps and deepfakes.}[left-center][1]
    
    ## Accessibility [left-center][1]

    {Face-swapping methods improved consistently throughout the 2000’s but reached a much younger audience in 2016 when Snapchat released a Face-Swap “Lens”. The accessibility of this technology led to disgusting use cases as with websites face-swapping celebrities onto pornographic images becoming increasingly popular. Legislation had and still has not caught up in most countries, often only the extremely wealthy or well-connected are able to get these images taken down and perpetrators punished. Although public figures are the most common victims, this was not the rule, and many victims were and still are left without justice or recourse. Paedophiles, the scum of humanity also gain access this technology, in which some cases used it to create illegal face-swaps of children they knew personally [6].}[left-center][1]

    ## Porno Images Look Like Kerrigan [all][1]

    {Figure Skater Nancy Kerrigan was one of the first high-profile victims of doctored pornography posted to the internet. Marvista Computing Co. defended their stance of hosting the images by calling them "obviously fake". The images were taken down after an Essex Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order. }[all][1]

    ## Exchanging Faces in Images [all][2]

    {An early automated face-swap method that could adjust for differences in viewpoint and illumination was created. The system is based on an algorithm that estimates 3D shape and texture, along with parameters such as pose and lighting. Users are still required to click roughly 7 feature points and mark the hairline of the subject. Authors suggest that their work can be used in image processing, virtual try-on of hairstyles, and facial recognition.}[all][2]

    ## Face2Face: Real-time Face Capture and Reenactment of RGB Videos [all][3]

    {Allows for real-time face-swaps onto a video source, allowing for manipulation without a target knowing the video is changed. Would be helpful for dubbing to foreign languages when on conference calls. Similar results have been achieved before offline, however this method allows online transfer of the facial expressions such as over video calls.}[all][3]
